# BetBlock - Decentralized Gaming on TRN Network

![BetBlock Logo](public/images/logo.png)

BetBlock is a revolutionary decentralized gaming platform built on TRN Network that combines GameFi and DeFi into a transparent, fair, and engaging user experience. Our mission is to provide a safe, secure, and transparent multiplayer platform that respects its users while delivering immersive gaming experiences.

## 🌟 The Origin Story

BetBlock was born out of a real experience with traditional gambling platforms. One of our team members encountered a deceptive "200% bonus" offer on a centralized casino platform that came with hidden wager requirements, making it nearly impossible to withdraw funds. After losing their deposit due to these hidden terms, they were inspired to create something better.

BetBlock aims to solve this problem by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure complete transparency, fairness, and true ownership for all players.
